Finding the unicode range of a hex(\x\u) character

nicode uses numeric code points to represent characters, with each character having a unique code point. For example, the Latin letter "A" is represented by the Unicode code point U+0041, the Greek letter "Σ" is U+03A3, the Chinese character "你" is U+4F60, and so on.

Unicode encompasses thousands of characters, including different scripts, symbols, punctuation, emojis, and more. Unicode standards include various character encoding schemes, with the most common ones being UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. These encoding schemes specify how Unicode code points are mapped to binary representations, allowing computers to store and process text data.
